This is the Graduate Thesis work of Hector Leiva. 

I am developing an iPhone application using Titanium Appcelerator. The main functions of the application are to connect to an Amazon S3 server and upload user-generated audio files that are saved at the geo-location in which they are recorded. Then to have users physically be in the same geo-location where the original audio recording took place in order to listen to them as they are being streamed from the Amazon S3 Server.
